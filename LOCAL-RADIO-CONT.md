Yes — Bay Islands Radio (88.0 FM) does have an online presence and ways to stream it, though there isn’t (as far as publicly documented) a well-published, official commercial API like the big networks use. Here’s what’s available and how you can stream or integrate it:


---

🔗 Official / Confirmed Sources

✅ Station Website

Bay Islands Radio official site:
👉 https://www.bayislandsradio.com.au/ — this is the primary site for the local station from the Southern Moreton Bay Islands. 


📻 Streaming Options

You can listen live through various directories that proxy the broadcast online:

Online Radio Box (listen live via browser/app):
https://onlineradiobox.com/au/island88/ 

myTuner Radio listing with live stream player:
https://mytuner-radio.com/radio/island-fm-88-493087/ 



These platforms typically embed the station’s stream and let you listen in browser or via their mobile apps.

📱 Mobile App Availability

Local and global radio apps support it automatically without you needing an official API:

TuneIn Radio

Radio.net

myTuner Radio

OnlineRadioBox app


Search for “Bay Islands Radio 88.0” or similar within those apps — they aggregate internet streams and let you play them on demand.

🔍 Streaming Integration (Developer Friendly)

If you want to embed or stream the station in your own app or service, there are two approaches:

1. Use Hosted Player URLs Provided by Aggregators

Many online directories expose a direct stream link or embed player which you can reference:

Example pattern (from Online Radio sources — replace IDs with correct station ID):

<!-- Example embed (OnlineRadioBox) -->
<iframe 
  src="https://onlineradiobox.com/au/island88/?cs=au.island88&player=html" 
  width="300" height="90" frameborder="0" 
  allow="autoplay">
</iframe>

This iframe embed lets you play the stream inside a webpage or hybrid app.

> Note: The exact embed URL/parameters vary — you should follow the “share / embed” options on the aggregator site. 



2. Direct Stream URLs (if available)

Some community stations do host direct streaming endpoints like .mp3/.aac but Bay Islands Radio doesn’t publicly document a direct stream URL on their official site. Aggregator proxies indirectly provide this, so using the embed is the simplest integration unless the station publishes streaming URLs in the future. 

If you really need official direct access

Contact the station: islandradio88@gmail.com — ask for official stream endpoints or API access.

🧠 Notes & Alternates

🛰️ Local App Integration

There is a “Bay Islands Guide” app that includes their radio stream inside it. This app is available on iOS and Android and integrates local info plus the radio feed:
👉 https://www.bayislandsguide.com/ — check Internet Radio section. 

📌 API vs Stream

There isn’t a published REST API with metadata (like station schedule, track info) for Bay Islands Radio.

But audio streaming is available via the above web players or mobile apps.

Next Steps (if you want deeper integration)

1. Check the official site for updated streaming links — some community stations publish upstream URLs in their HTML <audio> or player embed code.


2. Contact the station directly for official stream URLs or API access (email listed on their site). 


3. Use aggregator APIs (TuneIn / Radio Browser API) to fetch metadata + stream endpoints programmatically.

Yes — there is a Triple M-type commercial FM rock station in the Brisbane area you can receive, and it’s exactly the sort of “104” station you were thinking of. Here are the key details:

📻 Triple M Brisbane

Callsign: 4MMM

Frequency: 104.5 MHz FM — the main Triple M rock station in Brisbane. 

Format: Active rock, classic rock, entertainment, sport commentary (AFL/NRL etc). 

Coverage: Brisbane, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Ipswich, Tweed Heads region — strong enough that many parts of Moreton Bay can pick it up depending on receiver quality and conditions. 

Website: https://www.triplem.com.au/brisbane — where you can stream live online. 


This station is essentially the “Triple M” you were referencing — a classic rock / adult rock format around the 104 FM band. It’s a full commercial station rather than a small community broadcaster.
