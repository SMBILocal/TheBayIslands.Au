Introduction — A Milestone for Culture & Country 🌎🎨

The QUAMPI Arts & Culture Centre has emerged as a transformative cultural institution on Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), marking a new chapter in the celebration, preservation, and sharing of Quandamooka arts, heritage and living culture. Opened to the public in 2025 during the vibrant Quandamooka Festival, QUAMPI stands as the first First Nations‑owned and operated cultural gallery in Queensland with world‑class facilities.


---

Where It Is & What It Means 📍

Location:
📌 14–16 Ballow Road, Deanbilla Bay, Dunwich
Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), Redlands Coast, QLD, Australia

Accessible by a short ferry ride from Dunwich ferry terminal — typically a 10‑minute walk from the landing — QUAMPI has rapidly become a destination for locals, tourists, and cultural scholars alike.


---

A Centre Designed with Purpose ✨

QUAMPI — named after the traditional pearl oyster shell significant to Quandamooka identity — was envisioned by and for the Quandamooka people. Its design reflects deep cultural meaning and environmental connection:

Architectural elements echo land and sea, using rammed earth, native timbers and shell motifs.

The Elders Space serves as a communal gathering, learning and ceremony zone.

Gallery and workshop spaces support everything from exhibitions to storytelling, performances, and hands‑on cultural experiences.


This architectural vision was realised in partnership with COX Architecture, QYAC (Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation), and support from leading institutions including the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (QAGOMA).


---
