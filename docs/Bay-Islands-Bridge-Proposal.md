📍 The Island Connection That Almost Was — Road Bridge Plans from Redland Bay to Stradbroke & Russell Island

For decades, the idea of connecting the Southern Moreton Bay Islands (SMBI) and North Stradbroke Island (Minjerribah) to the Queensland mainland by road has captured the imagination of residents, developers and infrastructure planners — and equally sparked controversy, environmental concern and community debate.

This article explores the history, proposals, planning context, and modern discussions around the concept of a bridge linking these island communities to Redland Bay and the wider Southeast Queensland transport network.

🧱 The 1985 Stradbroke Island Bridge Plan — A ‘What Could Have Been’

In early 2026, previously unseen historical planning documents were brought to light by Redland Bayside News, revealing a 1985 proposal for a major bridge connecting the Redlands mainland to North Stradbroke Island via Pannikin and Russell Islands. 

🪪 Key features of that 1985 proposal included:

Three major bridges each at least 12 metres wide, designed for a future four-lane highway. 

A route from Redland Bay, across Pannikin Island, through Russell Island, and over the Canaipa Channel to North Stradbroke Island. 

Detailed technical planning, including navigation clearances of up to 25 m, dedicated navigation spans, and required upgrades to mainland roads. 

Consideration of tolling and substantial infrastructure upgrades. 


The plan was formally considered, and proponents were asked for amendments, but by 1986 the Queensland Cabinet officially halted the project, naming it too costly and complex, coinciding with political shifts following the Fitzgerald Inquiry.

🛣️ Longer History: Bridge Ideas Go Back to the 1970s

Planning interest in a bridge to Russell Island and beyond goes further back than 1985:

In the 1970s, planning material showed road-link proposals for SMBI were first explored under the then Redland Shire and State Government, including discussions about future connections to Stradbroke. 

In 1982–1983, private sector bridge proposals were considered, with estimated costs around $45 million (1980s dollars), but no official government endorsement followed. 

By 1985, political backing had grown enough to commission tenders and route studies — yet by early 1986, the bridge idea was shelved indefinitely.

🤝 Current Infrastructure Reality & Local Government Planning

Today, Redland City Council and state agencies remain focused on transport for SMBI, but not as a bridge crossing:

🚢 Ferries & Marine Access

Council invests in ferry terminals and vehicle ferry services that serve Russell, Macleay, Lamb and Karragarra Islands — including upgrades to ferry infrastructure and terminals. 


🪨 Roads & Local Infrastructure

Road sealing and upgrades on island roads continue through the “Green Seal Program”, with Council sealing tens of kilometres of island road networks. 

The 2025–26 Council Budget allocated about $6.95 million to island infrastructure projects, covering community buildings, roadworks and marine facilities. 


📈 Growth & Planning Studies

The Southern Moreton Bay Islands Integrated Local Transport Plan (2011 review) analysed transport, population projections and infrastructure needs — but concluded that historic bridge proposals had no current government backing and water-based transport would remain essential. 



---

📣 Community Debate & Local Support Movements

While no official bridge project is currently funded by state or local government, there is ongoing community discussion:

Recently, a Change.org petition called for building a bridge to connect SMBI to the mainland, reflecting frustration with ferry parking and access issues for island residents. 

Long-standing local sentiment — seen in forums and discussions — often reflects a desire for improved transport access, balanced by concerns about cost, environment and island character.

🧭 Why the Bridge Debate Matters

Despite being shelved decades ago, the idea of a bridge remains a topic of conversation because:

1. Island transport and access are still vital community issues — ferries serve essential roles but have limits, especially for cars and freight.


2. Population growth projections for SMBI have periodically raised questions about capacity, planning and alternative transport infrastructure. 


3. Environmental considerations — Moreton Bay’s marine ecosystems, Ramsar-listed wetlands and dugong habitats — have historically been central to debates on major infrastructure projects.
