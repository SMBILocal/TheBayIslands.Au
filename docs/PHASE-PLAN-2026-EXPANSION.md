# 2026 Expansion: User Feedback, Feature Clarifications, and Roadmap Additions

## 1. Pricing Card Readability & Visuals
- The “Popular” card’s blue text is now hard to read on the gradient background. Solution: Make all text on this card pure white (#fff) or a very light color for maximum contrast.
- “Best value for most businesses” must be highly visible.

## 2. Feature Clarifications & Tooltips
- Remove or clarify “Browse Directory” as a paid feature (directory browsing is free for all users).
- Add tooltips/help text to each feature in the pricing cards to explain what each item means (e.g., hover or info icon).
- Add a FAQ: “Is the free tier always free?”
  - Yes, the free tier is always free. You can upgrade or downgrade to/from the free tier at any time.
- Clarify that all tiers include posting jobs and classifieds, with paid post limits per tier (1, 2, 5, 10, unlimited).
- Explain that paid articles are available per article/size (quarter, half, full page, front page, top of front page, etc.), and all articles are reviewed by admin/moderators before approval and must meet guidelines.
- Add that pricing covers the entire site (jobs, classifieds, events, articles, business listings), not just the business directory.
- For the $59.99 tier, allow 2 directory listings (with a shared dashboard). Separate dashboards require separate packages.
- For the top “Enterprise” tier, consider not advertising the price directly—let users inquire for custom pricing.

## 3. Posting & Approval Logic
- All job listings, events, business listings, and classifieds must be reviewed by admin/moderators before approval, unless they meet auto-approval guidelines.
- System should auto-approve if guidelines are met, otherwise hold for review.
- Article submissions are paid, reviewed, and must meet terms/guidelines.

## 4. Community Radio Widget (Bay Islands Radio)
- Add a section/widget for local community radio (Bay Islands Radio 98.8 or 88.9, confirm correct frequency).
- Widget to appear in the top header bar (centered), showing:
  - Live stream (play/pause button)
  - Current song info
  - Time/date
  - Station name
- Play button toggles to pause when streaming; always shows current status.
- Link to the local Bay Islands Radio website.

## 5. Documentation & Roadmap
- All above requirements to be documented and added to the phase plan and implementation roadmap.
- Continue with all remaining phase plan items in logical order.

## 6. Next Steps
- Update pricing constants and carousel for text color, feature clarifications, tooltips, and FAQ.
- Remove/clarify “Browse Directory” as a feature.
- Add documentation for all new requirements and update the phase plan.
- Plan the radio widget and add it to the roadmap.
- Adjust the $59.99 tier for 2 listings with a shared dashboard, and clarify custom pricing for the top tier.
- Continue with all other phase plan items and document progress.
