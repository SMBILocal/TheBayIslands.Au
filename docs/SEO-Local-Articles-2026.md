----

Exactly — that’s the next layer of advanced, world-class local SEO that will truly lock in page-one dominance for TheBayIslands.au. Since we now have all article content and article schemas, here’s how we implement each of those strategies professionally:


---

1️⃣ Schema for Directories, Events, Jobs

Directories (Local Businesses / Services)

Use LocalBusiness schema for every business/service listing:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Bay Islands Cafe",
  "image": "https://thebayislands.au/images/cafe.jpg",

    "addressCountry": "AU"
  },
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": -27.663,
    "longitude": 153.286
  },
  "openingHoursSpecification": [
    {
      "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
      "dayOfWeek": ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"],
      "opens": "06:00",
      "closes": "18:00"
    }
  ],
  "sameAs": [
    "https://www.facebook.com/bayislandscafe",
    "https://www.instagram.com/bayislandscafe"
  ]
}


---

Events

Use Event schema for community events, performances, markets, and island clubs:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Event",
  "name": "Russell Island Community Market",
  "startDate": "2026-02-10T08:00",
  "endDate": "2026-02-10T14:00",
  "eventAttendanceMode": "https://schema.org/OfflineEventAttendanceMode",
  "eventStatus": "https://schema.org/EventScheduled",
  "location": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "Russell Island Community Hall",
    "address": {
      "@type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "10 Island Ave",
      "addressLocality": "Russell Island",
      "addressRegion": "QLD",
      "postalCode": "4184",
      "addressCountry": "AU"
    }
  },
  "image": "https://thebayislands.au/images/market.jpg",
  "description": "Weekly community market featuring local produce, arts, and crafts on Russell Island.",
  "organizer": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "TheBayIslands.au",
    "url": "https://thebayislands.au"
  }
}


---

Jobs

Use JobPosting schema for SMBI classifieds/job board:

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org/",
  "@type": "JobPosting",
  "title": "Barista - Russell Island Cafe",
  "description": "Seeking a skilled barista for Russell Island Cafe. Must be experienced with coffee machines and customer service.",
  "identifier": {
    "@type": "PropertyValue",
    "name": "TheBayIslands.au",
    "value": "JOB-001"
  },
  "datePosted": "2026-01-15",
  "validThrough": "2026-02-15T23:59",
  "employmentType": "FULL_TIME",
  "hiringOrganization": {

  },
  "jobLocation": {

      "@type": "PostalAddress",

      "addressRegion": "QLD",
      "postalCode": "4184",
      "addressCountry": "AU"
    }
  },
  "baseSalary": {
    "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
    "currency": "AUD",
    "value": {"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":25,"unitText":"HOUR"}
  }
}


---

2️⃣ Siloed Internal Linking Plan

A silo structure organizes content into themes and improves SEO weight:

Articles Silo: /articles/ → new residents, buying, living, transport, accommodation, life, community, services, infrastructure

Directories Silo: /directory/ → local businesses, clubs, cafes, marinas

Events Silo: /events/ → markets, performances, community events

Jobs Silo: /jobs/ → all SMBI classifieds


Example internal linking:

Article “Living on the Islands” links to:

Accommodation (/articles/accommodation-on-the-islands)

Transport (/articles/transport-on-the-islands)

Directory (/directory/)


Directory listing links back to:

Related articles: “New to the Islands”, “Life on the Islands”

Events: “Upcoming Market at Island Hall”



> Siloing keeps topical relevance strong, signals authority to Google, and improves page crawl depth.




---

3️⃣ Keyword Hierarchy for SMBI Page-One Domination

Primary keywords:

South Moreton Bay Islands, SMBI, Russell Island, Macleay Island, Lamb Island, Karragarra Island


Secondary / long-tail keywords:

Living on Russell Island, Russell Island ferries, Macleay Island shops, SMBI community events, SMBI classifieds, Island accommodation, Island transport guide


Cluster pages:

Guides → “Buying on the Islands”, “Living on the Islands”

Services → “Island Businesses Directory”

Events → “SMBI Community Events”

Jobs → “Island Job Board”


> Every page targets primary + long-tail + local intent, giving full domination of SMBI SERPs.




---

4️⃣ Visual Media & Chart Strategy

Interactive maps: Show ferry routes, marinas, parking, car hire, public transport

Charts:

Island services by category (health, education, transport, events)

Weekly ferry timetable chart

Community events schedule table


Images optimized with ALT text:

“Russell Island ferry pier”

“Macleay Island bowls club”

“Lamb Island holiday accommodation”


Infographics:

Island lifestyle comparison: SMBI vs. Redlands mainland

Road upgrades & proposed development charts



> Visual media increases user engagement, time on site, and CTR — all ranking signals for Google.




---

If you want, I can create a full production-ready implementation package next:

All remaining schemas (directories, events, jobs) in JSON-LD ready for drop-in

Internal silo linking map visually represented

Keyword cluster map for each page

Charts and media strategy plan for SEO impact


This will be the final blueprint for SMBI domination in 2026.

Do you want me to generate that next?


---

Perfect — we’ll focus on articles 2, 3, 4, 5 now (all production-grade schema for each), skipping #1 since you said to forget it. I’ll produce full JSON-LD structured schema ready for drop-in, fully optimized for 2026 SEO, including keywords, internal links, and authority outbound links.

2. Then move to lifestyle & transport:

The article content is still required for ultimate SEO performance, each page keyword-optimized, with internal links to locations, external links to council/ferry/TransLink/schools, and local points of interest.

Once these are produced, we can also add structured JSON-LD for each article: FAQ, HowTo, Event references (if relevant), BreadcrumbList, and Publisher schema for full SEO coverage.



---

If you want, I can start immediately generating the first batch of high-impact, production-ready articles in full 2026 SEO standard, including:

“New to the Islands”

“Thinking of Buying on the Islands”

“Living on the Islands”


Each article will be fully keyword-optimized, location-rich, include internal + external links, emoji & callouts where appropriate, and ready to dominate page 1.

Do you want me to start with these 3 articles next?

✅ Next Steps:

We can now proceed to mainland pages:

1. Redland Bay


2. Cleveland


3. Victoria Point


4. Capalaba



If you want, I can produce all 4 mainland schemas next in the same fully structured, production-ready format.

Do you want me to do that immediately?

Perfect. We’ll continue island by island, then mainland, giving you full production-ready pages with embedded JSON-LD schema, all-inclusive, all-keyword optimized, fully linked, ready to drop directly into the website.

We’ll start with Macleay Island next.

This page is now fully SEO-dominant, structured, schema-ready, with outbound authority links, events, FAQs, transport details, and local info, ready for production.

I can now generate the next 6 pages (Lamb Island, Karragarra Island, Redland Bay, Cleveland, Victoria Point, Capalaba) all in the same fully structured, production-ready format in one go.
