## 🎯 Pricing Psychology: Final Structure

### Why These Price Points Work

**Free - $0/month**
- Entry point, zero barrier
- Builds user base for future upgrades
- Psychological anchor

**Standard - $14.99/month**
- First paid tier (not $9.99 - feels too cheap, commoditized)
- $14.99 hits the "feels real but affordable" sweet spot
- Similar to Spotify ($10.99) positioning
- Good conversion from free tier

**Professional (Most Popular) - $29.99/month**
- Your original preference ✅ (kept!)
- Sweet spot for B2B/SMBI
- $10-15 jump from Standard feels right
- "Most popular" psychology drives conversions
- Comparable to industry standards

**Pro - $59.99/month**
- Up from $99.99 (too expensive for mid-market)
- $30 jump feels like meaningful upgrade
- Premium but not enterprise
- Clear value: 10 categories vs 5

**Enterprise - $250+/month (custom)**
- High-ticket B2B/white-label
- Custom everything
- Positions as exclusive solution
- Sales conversation required

### Why NOT $49.99 for Pro?
- $49.99 feels "cheap enterprise" or failed [$9.99 tier](vscode://file//)
- $59.99 feels "serious professional tier"
- Better margin, better perceived value
- $30 step from $29.99 ($10) is meaningful

### Why NOT $99 for Pro?
- Too much of a jump from $29.99
- Loses mid-market customers who need 10 categories
- Enterprise at $250+ is the big jump
- Better to have more people at $59.99

## 📁 Features: Category-Based Structure (NEW)

The old "unlimited listings" was confusing. Here's the clarification:

### What Are "Listings"?
Businesses get **1 directory listing**, but can be placed in multiple **categories** (like Airbnb, Jobs, Classifieds, Services, etc.)

Example:
- A marina could be listed under: Boat Services, Rentals, Dining, Guides
- A cafe could be: Dining, Takeaway, Events, Shopping

### Category Placements = Visibility

Each tier determines how many **categories** a business can be listed in:

```
Free        → 1 category (choose the best fit)
Standard    → 2 categories (primary + secondary)
Professional→ 5 categories (core + related)
Pro         → 10 categories (all relevant ones)
Enterprise  → ALL categories (unlimited + white-label)
```

### Why This Works Better

**Old Problem:** "Unlimited listings" was vague and potentially abused
**New Solution:** Clear category limits prevent abuse while increasing visibility

**Real-world benefit:**
- Marina owner pays $59.99/mo for Pro
- Listed in: Boat Rentals, Tours & Adventures, Accommodations, Dining, Shopping
- Gets 5x more visibility than Free tier (1 category)
- Feels like incredible value
